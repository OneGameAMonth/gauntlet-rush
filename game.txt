To save on time, make the game short (ten areas?) But challenging (not nintendo hard), so overcoming each area is not a breeze but also isnt discouraging, and make a point system for stylish monster beating/gauntlet challenge overcoming/time?

"I must take this challenge and prove myself." 
"Why won't you leave me alone!?"
for a girl it becomes increasingly evident that she has no interest in you

1. Add story opening, end, and between levels (zelda dialogue)
2. Create other monsters and set up the levels.
3. IF YOU TAKE A HEART, DON'T SAVE, AND MOVE ON AND DIE, REGENERATE THE HEART CONTAINER!!!
	-ADD FAIRIES/MINIHEARTS TO HEAL YOU WHEN THERE IS NO HEART CONTAINER!!!
4. (Display "Level 01")
