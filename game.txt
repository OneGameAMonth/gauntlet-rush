To save on time, make the game short (ten areas?) But challenging (not nintendo hard), so overcoming each area is not a breeze but also isnt discouraging, and make a point system for stylish monster beating/gauntlet challenge overcoming/time?

"I must take this challenge and prove myself." 
"Why won't you leave me alone!?"
for a girl it becomes increasingly evident that she has no interest in you
