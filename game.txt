To save on time, make the game short (ten areas?) But challenging (not nintendo hard), so overcoming each area is not a breeze but also isnt discouraging, and make a point system for stylish monster beating/gauntlet challenge overcoming/time?

"If you truly love me, you must prove yourself worthy of my affection."
"I must take this challenge and prove myself." for a girl it becomes increasingly evident that she has no interest in you

1. Prevent shield block when charging sword
2. Fix damage blinker to a color transform
3. Make monsters have ATTACK strength attribute that is used to subtract from hero's health
4. Create other monsters and set up the levels.
5. Boss(es, at most 2)
6. HUD for health and points. Also institute point system.
7. Add story opening, end, and between levels (zelda dialogue)
