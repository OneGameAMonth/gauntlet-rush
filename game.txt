To save on time, make the game short (ten areas?) But challenging (not nintendo hard), so overcoming each area is not a breeze but also isnt discouraging, and make a point system for stylish monster beating/gauntlet challenge overcoming/time?

"I must take this challenge and prove myself." 
"Why won't you leave me alone!?"
for a girl it becomes increasingly evident that she has no interest in you

1. Add story opening, end, and between levels (zelda dialogue)
2. Create other monsters and set up the levels.
3. Add "PRESS X TO ROLL, Z TO STAB/CHARGE"
4. Equalize all the sounds.
	-Sounds for projectile firing (magic beams and octorocks)
5. (Display "Level 01")
	-POINT SYSTEM (killing enemies ++, dying--)

PLAYTEST::
-Make evident that SAVE POINT saves game (glowy spot and flash???)
-Make more evident roll attack and sword charge(???)
-Rope gets stuck on brick like an idiot
-Small Short Death Animation
-SPAWN IN PORTCULLIS PREVIOUS, DON'T MAKE IT APPEAR UNLESS YOU WALK FORWARD SOME ("ToLastRoom");
-RELOAD CHECKPOINT = SAVE THE X/Y position OF PLAYER
-Global.swordCharge???
